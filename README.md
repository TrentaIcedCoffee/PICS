# UC Davis Department Contact
This is a training guide for SISS departmental contacts to learn how to use the UC Davis Department Contact website.

## Background Information
In order to obtain and maintain administrative access to process scholar visa requests in iGlobal, SISS requires department contacts to create and update a profile at the UC Davis Department Contacts website.  If the contact’s profile at this website expires, iGlobal access will be removed and the contact’s profile will be deleted from the website.  SISS will send reminders to contacts three times: 2 months, 1 month and 1 week prior to expiration.  
UC Davis Department Contacts allows staff to create and update their profile to reflect any changes in assigned departments for processing visa requests.  SISS and departmental contacts may use this website to search for assigned contacts for each department that processes visas.
